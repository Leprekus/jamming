# Jamming React App
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to deploy a react application using the spotify api. The user should be able to log into the application using his Spotify login credentials, search for songs, name, and add playlists to their account. One of the project's goals is to implement a custom feature. The implemented feature consists of finding playlists containing the specified song. The purpose of this feature is to be able to see which playlists contain a song so it becomes easier to create playlists with a consistent mood.
